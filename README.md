# Cryptocurrencies

For this anlysis, I used unsupervised machine learning to discover trends in the cryptocurrency market.

There were four parts to this analysis:
* Preprocessing the data for PCA
* Reducing data dimensions using PCA
* Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means
* Visualizing cryptocurrencies results
